                               Boot Disk
                               ---------
 
 In Pursuit of Greed will run perfectly fine in 8 megs of RAM, but you 
MUST have smartdrive turned off! (And usually EMM386 and HIMEM, as
well.) If you are an experienced computer user, you can edit CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT to "rem out" all SMARTDRV, EMM386 and HIMEM lines. If
you have no idea what the last sentence meant, or just want a
convenient way to run In Pursuit of Greed without any hassles, make a
boot disk!

 After the game is installed, you are given the option of making a boot
disk. Your system boots from your "A" drive, which can be either a
5.25" or 3.5" drive. You need a floppy of the appropriate size, either
blank, or one that you don't mind having reformatted.

 Follow the prompts and when it's done, you have a boot disk that takes
into account your specific drivers and removes all references to
SMARTDRV, EMM386 and HIMEM from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
FROM THE BOOT DISK ONLY!

 To use your boot disk, make sure it is in the drive and reboot your
system. In Pursuit of Greed will run automatically. (NOTE: Some hard-
drives require you to boot up without the boot disk in the drive; you
hit space bar to boot from a floppy after the hard drive spins up and
it gives you a prompt.)


 If you have 16 megs or more of RAM, you probably don't need to
worry about any of this. But if you experience any trouble with lock-
ups or crashes, you may want to make a boot disk.

 To make a boot disk without re-installing the game, change to the
directory where you installed the game and type "GREEDMB" then press
<Enter>.


                              WINDOWS 95
                              ----------
 In Pursuit of Greed will run under SOME Windows 95 systems
perfectly fine just by double-clicking on the GREED.EXE icon. However,
you will probably experience a break-up in the music as the game and
new levels load.
 If the game just doesn't seem to work on your system, or if you just
want In Pursuit of Greed to run its best, you should make a boot disk.
The game will run faster but you lose multi-tasking capabilities.
 The installer option to "Reboot System" will not reboot a Windows 95
system, it will just exit from the DOS prompt. You will need to go to
"START" and select "Shutdown" and "Reboot system" to get up and running.
                                  
                                  
                            Virtual Reality
                            ---------------
 Support for SimulEyes VR glasses was added after the manual went to
press. In the SETUP.EXE program, there is a "VR HELMET" menu choice.
From this menu you can choose "None" or "SimulEyes". Once you make the
choice, it stays in effect until you run SETUP again and change it.

 If the SimulEyes don't seem to be working, press "<Shift> F5" to turn
them on and reset the depth and angle parameters. While playing the
game, you can adjust the depth and angle parameters to get the best 3D
view for your eyes by pressing the following keys:

       <Shift> F1  ;Change angle by -1
       <Shift> F2  ;Change angle by +1
       <Shift> F3  ;Change depth by -0.1                   
       <Shift> F4  ;Change depth by +0.1                            
       <Shift> F5  ;Reset the Angle and depth to default values


                         Installation Problems
                         ---------------------
 If the installation process is interupted but the entire game has been
installed, you may run it by manually changing to the game directory and
typing GREED! and then pressing <Enter>.  You can make a boot disk at any
time by changing to the game directory and typing GREEDMB and then <Enter>.

                                 Greed

        It is the year 15392.  The Sengzhac empire has fallen to the 
flames of decadence and insurrection, its noble houses crushed and 
suffering in exile.  From the chaos have risen tyrants and petty 
dictators who consort with criminal clans to tighten their grip on 
their rule.
        
        The main source of entertainment, prestige, and ill-gotten gains
is a space borne gambling casino known as the Red Hunter.  Run by the 
crime lord Arbiter, hunters from all corners of the galaxy gather in
hopes  of winning a Hunt - garnering wealth, fame, and favor in the
eyes of their overlords.
        
        You are a Hunter.  You've got a gun.  You know how to use it.

Misc. Info

-If the A.S.S. Cam is set to maximum delay it will only take a snapshot 
when toggled.  To view the ASS cam continuously set the delay for the 
smallest value you can. (in the options menu)

-If the Map in your HUD is on, your Heat and Motion Sensor lights will 
appear on the map itself where appropriate.  If the map is not active 
these lights will appear in a boxed display on the left of the main 
display. 

-If the Heat and Motion Sensors are inactive, toggling the map a second 
time will cause the the map to rotate with you as you move.  Cool.

-To know if your Heat and Motion Sensors are active, look to the bottom
right of your display (you must have the life indicator active.)

Green Light     Auto Mapper Active
Blue Light      Motion Sensors Active
Red Light       Heat Sensors Active

-Picking up Random Items will restore a substantial amount of health
and  shield strength as well as giving you a point bonus.  They are
invaluable in network play.  Get them.

-Clones won't shoot you but will shoot other clones.  Powerful new 
weapons and an increased firing speed make clones dangerous adversaries.
They shred NOPS and hunters alike.  Beware.

If it's moving, kill it.  If it's not nailed down, steal it.
