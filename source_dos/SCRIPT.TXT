Overview
--------
	The script file, associated with each layer file, is used for the
definition of virtual objects, those objects which are outside the influence
of other sprites.  Only the player (or network player) can affect triggers
and wall switches.  The script file is also used for the initialization of
sprites and elevators.  Monsters should be defined with the script file
rather than placed in the map directly although both methods are valid.
Defining monsters in the script, however, allows for more options than
would normally be possible.


Definitions
-----------
zone: area effect defined by a rectanglar region of the map

sprite: monsters or objects that have hitpoints and the ability to move

trigger: pressure sensitive map locations

wall switch: player must press space bar while facing a switch texture
 defined in the map editor.

event: a value (eval) is broadcast.

broadcast: all zones, elevators, and spawn events are activated if they
 equal the event value being sent.

Parameter Descriptions
----------------------
 x1         : upper left corner x position (0..XMAX)
 y1         : upper left corner y position (0..YMAX)
 x2         : lower right corner x position (0..XMAX && x2>=x1)
 y2         : lower right corner y position (0..YMAX && y2>=y1)
 eval       : event value to be broadcast or reacted upon (1..255)
 removeable : if 0, erase after event, if 1, do not erase
 endeval    : event value to broadcast after completed action
 layer      : map layer (0..NUMLAYERS, see below)
 mval       : new map layer value (0..255)
 mrate      : rate to change from old value to new map value (1..255)
	       1=slowest, 255=instantaneous
 etype      : elevator type (0=start low, 1=start high)
 upper      : highest height value for elevator (0..255 && upper>lower)
 lower      : lowest height value for elevator (0..255)
 speed      : rate of change for elevator (1..255, default=4 currently)
 stype      : sprite number
 ceval      : event value that sprite broadcasts when it croaks (0..255, 0
	       is no broadcast)
 def1       : lower difficulty value (0..MAXDIFF
 def2       : upper difficulty value (0..MAXDIFF && def2>=def1)
	       sprite is spawned only if the current difficulty level is
	       between def1 & def2 inclusive.
 x          : x map location (0..XMAX)
 y          : y map location (0..YMAX)
 pnum       : primary item number (0,1)
 snum       : secondary item number (0..6)
 psprite    : indexed number of the sprite for the item
 val        : point value
 total      : total number of this secondary item
 time       : time in seconds (1..120)
 teval      : trigger's new value removeable
 snum       : sound effect number (see below)
 fn         : fli file number
 name       : lump name of sprite
 n          : number of frames to load


Examples & Possibilities
------------------------
1) sprite 1 50 0 23 0 0 3
   sprite 1 50 0 24 0 4 5
 means: a sprite with number 23 is spawned at location 1,50 at the beginning
  (eval=0) if the difficulty level is between 0 and 3. a sprite with number
  24 is spawned at 1,50 at the beginning if the difficulty is between 4 and
  5.
