                               In Pursuit of 
                                   GREED

        It is the year 15392.  The Sengzhac empire has fallen to the 
flames of decadence and insurrection, its noble houses crushed and 
suffering in exile.  From the chaos have risen tyrants and petty 
dictators who consort with criminal clans to tighten their grip on 
their rule.
        
        The main source of entertainment, prestige, and ill-gotten gains
is a space borne gambling casino known as the Red Hunter.  Run by the 
crime lord Arbiter, hunters from all corners of the galaxy gather in hopes 
of winning a Hunt - garnering wealth, fame, and favor in the eyes of their 
overlords.
        
        You are a Hunter.  You've got a gun.  You know how to use it.  
Let the games begin.

Misc. Info

-If your A.S.S. Cam is set to maximum delay it will only take a snapshot 
when toggled.  To view the ASS cam continuously set the delay for the 
smallest value you can. (in the options menu)

-If the Map in your HUD is on, your Heat and Motion Sensor lights will 
appear on the map itself where appropriate.  If the map is not active 
these lights will appear in a boxed display on the left of the main 
display. 

-If the Heat and Motion Sensors are inactive, toggling the map a second 
time will cause the the map to rotate with you as you move.  Pretty neat.

-To know if your Heat and Motion Sensors are active look to the bottom
right of your display (you must at least have the life indicator active.)

Green Light     Auto Mapper Active
Blue Light      Motion Sensors Active
Red Light       Heat Sensors Active

-Picking up Random Items will restore a substantial amount of health and 
shield strength as well as giving you a point bonus.  They are invaluable 
in network play.  Get them.

-Clones won't shoot you but will shoot other clones.  Powerful new 
weapons and an increased firing speed make clones dangerous adversaries.  
They shred NOPS and hunters alike.  Beware.
